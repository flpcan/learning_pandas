1.

region_1 and region_2 are pretty uninformative names for locale columns in the dataset. Create a copy of reviews with these columns renamed to region and locale, respectively.

renamed = reviews.rename(columns={'region_1': 'region',"region_2" : "locale"})



2.

Set the index name in the dataset to wines.


reindexed = reviews.rename_axis("wines", axis='rows')

The Things on Reddit dataset includes product links from a selection of top-ranked forums ("subreddits") on reddit.com. Run the cell below to load a dataframe of products mentioned on the /r/gaming subreddit and another dataframe for products mentioned on the r//movies subreddit.


gaming_products = pd.read_csv("../input/things-on-reddit/top-things/top-things/reddits/g/gaming.csv")
gaming_products['subreddit'] = "r/gaming"
movie_products = pd.read_csv("../input/things-on-reddit/top-things/top-things/reddits/m/movies.csv")
movie_products['subreddit'] = "r/movies"

Create a DataFrame of products mentioned on either subreddit.

combined_products = pd.concat([gaming_products, movie_products])

The Powerlifting Database dataset on Kaggle includes one CSV table for powerlifting meets and a separate one for powerlifting competitors. Run the cell below to load these datasets into dataframes:


powerlifting_meets = pd.read_csv("../input/powerlifting-database/meets.csv")
powerlifting_competitors = pd.read_csv("../input/powerlifting-database/openpowerlifting.csv")
Both tables include references to a `MeetID`, a unique key for each meet (competition) included in the database. Using this, generate a dataset combining the two tables into one.

powerlifting_combined = powerlifting_meets.set_index("MeetID").join(powerlifting_competitors.set_index("MeetID"))
